# TB-parameters
There are three folders for three materials: MoS₂, InSe, and MoS₂-WS₂ heterostructure.
Each folder contains: 
  (1) Single-layer orbital coefficients cij (coefficientMatrices.lobster);
  (2) Interlayer hopping integrals t (RealSpaceHamiltonians.lobster);
  (3) Interlayer Overlap integrals s (RealSpaceOverlaps.lobster).
